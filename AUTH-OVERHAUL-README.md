# Authentication System Overhaul

## Overview

This update replaces the workaround-based authentication system with a clean, direct implementation using Supabase Auth. The new system is more reliable, maintainable, and secure.

## Key Changes

1. **Removed Authentication Workarounds**: Eliminated the need for mapping problematic users to test accounts
2. **Standardized React Usage**: Fixed React import inconsistencies across the application
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for authentication operations
4. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types for authentication-related data
5. **Simplified Authentication Flow**: Streamlined the authentication process for better reliability

## File Changes

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - New authentication service with direct Supabase integration
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to use the new authentication service
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Improved Supabase configuration and error handling
- `auth-migration.js` - Script to migrate users from the workaround to the new system
- `.env.example` - Added example environment variables file

## How to Use the New Authentication System

### Environment Setup

1. Ensure your `.env.local` file has the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

2. If your Supabase URL is not set in the `.env.local` file, the system will fall back to the hardcoded URL.

### Sign In

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

// In your component
const { signIn } = useAuth();

// Sign in with email and password
await signIn(email, password);
```

### Sign Up

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

// In your component
const { signUp } = useAuth();

// Sign up with email, password, name, and role
await signUp(email, password, name, 'learner');
```

### Sign Out

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

// In your component
const { signOut } = useAuth();

// Sign out the current user
await signOut();
```

### Getting User Details

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

// In your component
const { user, userDetails, isLoading } = useAuth();

if (isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

if (user && userDetails) {
  return <div>Welcome, {userDetails.name}!</div>;
}
```

## Migration Process

To migrate existing users from the workaround system to the new system:

1. Run the migration script:
   ```
   node auth-migration.js
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Read mappings from `auth-mappings.json`
   - Create proper Supabase Auth users for each mapped user
   - Add user records to the database
   - Generate a report of successful and failed migrations

3. After migration:
   - Users can log in directly with their original email and password
   - The workaround system will be disabled
   - The old mappings file will be backed up

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failures**: 
   - Check that the user exists in both Supabase Auth and the users table
   - Verify that the password meets the minimum requirements (6 characters)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure your `.env.local` file contains the correct Supabase URL and key
   - Restart the development server after changing environment variables

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Run the diagnostic tool to check connection status
   - Verify that the Supabase service is online

### Diagnostic Tool

The application includes a diagnostic tool that checks:
- Authentication configuration
- User state
- Supabase connection

Access it at `/diagnostic` in the application.

## Reverting (Emergency Only)

If you need to revert to the old system:

1. Restore the backup of `auth-mappings.json`
2. Change the imports in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` back to use the workaround
