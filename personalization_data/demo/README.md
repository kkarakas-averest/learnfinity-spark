# LearnFinity AI Personalized Course Demo

This interactive demo showcases our AI-powered personalized learning system that creates tailored courses for employees transitioning to new roles.

## How to Use This Demo

1. **Open `index.html` in a web browser** to launch the demo
2. **Switch between views** using the toggle at the top right:
   - **Student View:** See what learners experience
   - **Process View:** Understand the AI backend logic

## Student View Features

The Student View demonstrates the learner's experience:

- Browse the 4-week course structure
- Navigate between modules
- Read module content (first 2 modules fully implemented)
- See how content connects to the learner's existing skills

## Process View Features

The Process View explains how our AI system works:
