# Implementation Plan: Employee Profile Page

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Employee Profile Page feature in the LearnFinity HR Dashboard. This feature will provide comprehensive information about employees, including personal details, learning preferences, skills, and history, serving as a data source for LLM agents to personalize learning content.

## Goals
- Create a comprehensive employee profile page for HR administrators
- Design and implement an expanded employee data model to support personalization
- Build UI components for viewing and editing employee profiles
- Develop data collection strategy for learning preferences and styles
- Integrate with the LLM service for personalized learning content

## Component Structure

### 1. Data Model Enhancements

  - Preferred learning time periods
  - Primary device used for learning
  - Language preferences
  - Session duration preferences
  - Skills inventory with proficiency levels
  - Career goals and aspirations
  - Content format preferences

### 2. New Components

#### Employee Profile Page (`/src/pages/hr/EmployeeProfilePage.tsx`)
- Main container for the employee profile view
- Tabbed interface for different sections of the profile

#### Profile Components:
- **Personal Info Section** (`/src/components/hr/profile/PersonalInfoCard.tsx`)
  - Display basic employee information
  - Edit functionality for HR administrators

- **Learning Profile Section** (`/src/components/hr/profile/LearningProfileCard.tsx`)
  - Display learning preferences
  - Configuration options for preferred learning styles
  - Visualization of learning patterns

- **Skills Inventory** (`/src/components/hr/profile/SkillsInventory.tsx`)
  - Current skills with proficiency indicators
  - Skills gap analysis visualization
  - Required skills for current role

- **Learning History** (`/src/components/hr/profile/LearningHistory.tsx`)
  - Timeline of completed courses
  - Performance metrics visualization
  - Time spent on different learning activities

- **Career Development** (`/src/components/hr/profile/CareerDevelopment.tsx`)
  - Career goals tracking
  - Development plan progress
  - Recommended growth opportunities

- **Feedback & Preferences** (`/src/components/hr/profile/FeedbackPreferences.tsx`)
  - Content format preferences
  - Historical feedback on different content types
  - Topics of interest

### 3. Service Integration

#### Employee Profile Service (`/src/services/employeeProfileService.ts`)
- API endpoints for fetching and updating employee profiles
- Methods for retrieving specific profile sections
- Batch operations for multiple employees

#### LLM Integration (`/src/lib/llm/profile-integration.ts`)
- Helper functions to prepare employee profile data for LLM context
- Methods to transform LLM responses into actionable recommendations
- Utilities for contextualizing content based on profile data

### 4. Database Schema Updates
- New tables for storing extended profile information
- Relations to existing employee data
- Migration scripts for schema updates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Model & Basic UI
- Define extended employee data model
- Create UI components for viewing profile data
- Implement read-only profile page

### Phase 2: Edit Functionality
- Add edit capabilities to all profile sections
- Implement validation and error handling
- Create saving/updating functionality

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
- Develop methods for LLM to access profile data
- Create prompts that incorporate profile information
- Implement feedback loop for learning content effectiveness

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Implement skills gap analysis
- Add career development tracking
- Create visualizations for learning patterns and preferences

## Routing Updates
Add new routes in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/hr-dashboard/employees/:employeeId/profile" element={<ProtectedRouteMigrated userRoles={['hr', 'superadmin']} component={EmployeeProfilePage} />} />
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual profile components
- Integration tests for data flow between profile sections
- End-to-end tests for the profile editing workflow
- Usability testing with HR administrators

## Dependencies
- Existing employee data model
- Authentication and authorization system
- LLM service for personalization recommendations

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all forms are accessible with proper labels
- Provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Use ARIA attributes appropriately for complex UI components
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
