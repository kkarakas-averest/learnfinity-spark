# State Management Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating components from the old context-based state management to the new state management system.

| src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to RegisterPageMigrated.tsx |
| src/pages/Dashboard.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to DashboardMigrated.tsx |
| src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to ProfilePageMigrated.tsx |
| src/components/Navbar.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to NavbarMigrated.tsx |
| src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to DashboardLayoutMigrated.tsx |
| src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx | ✅ | Migrated to ProtectedRouteMigrated.tsx |
| src/components/hr/HRLogin.tsx | ❌ | Not yet migrated |
| src/components/hr/HRDashboard.tsx | ❌ | Not yet migrated |

## Migration Details

### Successfully Migrated Components

- **mainMigrated.tsx**: Uses the new state management providers
- **LoginPageMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUI hooks for auth and notifications
- **RegisterPageMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUI hooks for registration and notifications
- **ProtectedRouteMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth hook to handle route protection
- **NavbarMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUser, and useUI hooks for auth state and UI updates
- **DashboardLayoutMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUI hooks for auth state and UI updates
- **DashboardMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUI hooks for auth state and loading management
- **ProfilePageMigrated.tsx**: Uses useAuth, useUser, and useUI hooks for user data and error management

### Components Pending Migration

- **App.tsx**: Main router component
- **HRLogin.tsx & HRDashboard.tsx**: HR-specific components to be migrated with HR auth hooks
- **DiagnosticTool.tsx, CourseDetails.tsx, LearningPath.tsx**: Learning-focused components

## Next Steps

1. Migrate remaining HR-specific components (HRLogin, HRDashboard)
2. Migrate learning-focused components (DiagnosticTool, CourseDetails, LearningPath)
3. Migrate App.tsx to use the new migrated components
4. Replace original files with migrated versions and update imports

## Migration Approach

Each component is migrated by:
1. Creating a new component with "Migrated" suffix
2. Replacing context APIs with appropriate hooks from new state management
3. Enhancing error handling and loading states
4. Adding proper TypeScript types
5. Testing functionality

## Benefits of New State Management

- Type safety across the application
- Better error handling with standardized error messages
- Improved loading state visualization
- Simplified component code with custom hooks
- More consistent developer experience

## Technical Debt Reduction

The migration has helped reduce technical debt by:
- Removing prop drilling
- Standardizing state management patterns
- Adding TypeScript types to previously untyped components
- Centralizing business logic in hooks
