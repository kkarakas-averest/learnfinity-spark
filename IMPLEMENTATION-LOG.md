## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on connecting the agent system to the HR Dashboard UI. This includes:

1. Initializing the agent system when the HR Dashboard loads
2. Connecting employee data to the agent system for RAG status analysis
3. Displaying agent-generated insights in the UI
4. Implementing real-time notifications based on agent analysis

## Upcoming Milestones

1. **Week 6-7: RAG System Agent Integration**
   - Connect agent system to UI
   - Implement batch processing for RAG status updates
   - Add real-time notification based on agent insights

2. **Week 8-9: Core Learner UI**
   - Create Learner Dashboard
   - Implement learning path visualization
   - Display personalized content recommendations

3. **Week 10: Learner Feedback System**
   - Add feedback collection components
   - Integrate feedback with agent analysis
   - Create feedback reporting for HR

## Technical Debt & Issues

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Lazy loading in App.tsx | Medium | Removed temporarily to fix linter errors |
| Type safety in agent interactions | Medium | Need stronger typing for agent message payloads |
| Mock data usage | Low | Replace with real data connections when ready |

## Dependencies & Integration Points

- **Supabase**: Database and authentication
- **React Router**: Navigation between dashboard pages
- **CrewAI**: Foundation for the agent system (implemented)
- **Groq API**: Planned integration for LLM capabilities (not yet implemented)
