- **RAGSystemAgent Implementation**
  - Added proper interface implementation for `RAGSystemAgent` with required methods:
    - `id` property with UUID initialization
    - `receiveMessage` method for processing incoming messages
    - `processTask` method for handling RAG status determination tasks
  - Enhanced initialization logic in agent system to properly handle errors
  - Improved robustness of agent initialization with proper error handling

### 2. UI Enhancements

- **HR Dashboard Settings Page**
  - Created dedicated settings page for HR Dashboard with tabbed interface
  - Implemented LLM Configuration UI in settings page
  - Updated routing to include settings page in HR Dashboard section
  - Added navigation to settings page from HR Dashboard header

- **NotificationBadge Component**
  - Fixed icon import issues in NotificationBadge component
  - Updated dependency to latest version of lucide-react

### 3. LLM Service Improvements

- **Enhanced Prompts for RAG Status Determination**
  - Added detailed guidelines for RED, AMBER, and GREEN status determination
  - Implemented comprehensive prompt structure with sections for:
    - RAG status determination
    - Justification based on metrics
    - Key metrics analysis
    - Recommended actions
    - Follow-up timeline
  - Enhanced the system prompts with contextual factors to consider during analysis

- **Robust LLM Service Configuration**
  - Improved error handling in LLM service initialization
  - Enhanced provider selection logic with better fallback mechanisms
  - Added support for mock provider when LLM services are unavailable

### 4. Bug Fixes & Code Quality Improvements

- **React Hook Dependencies**
  - Fixed missing dependencies in useEffect hook in HRDashboardMigrated component
  - Prevented stale closures by ensuring all dependencies are properly listed

- **Employee Batch Analysis**
  - Restructured analyzeAllEmployees function to avoid direct array mutations
  - Improved state update handling and error management during batch processing

- **Build & Deployment Issues**
  - Fixed Vercel deployment failures related to groq-sdk package:
    - Implemented dynamic imports for groq-sdk to handle build-time issues
    - Added proper externalization in Vite config for groq-sdk
    - Enhanced client initialization with lazy loading pattern
  - Fixed TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.node.json:

## Pending Features & Next Steps

Based on the HR Dashboard PRD, the following features are prioritized for upcoming implementation:

1. **Enhanced Employee Detail View**
   - Progress timeline visualization
   - Intervention history tracking
   - Improved feedback display

2. **Advanced RAG Status Visualization**
   - Visual indicators of status trends over time
   - Department/team level aggregated views
   - Filtering and sorting by RAG status

3. **Notification System Enhancements**
   - User notification preferences
   - Scheduled notification delivery
   - Template-based notification content

4. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Department-level progress reports
   - Trend analysis for learning engagement

## Technical Debt & Considerations

- Consider refactoring agent initialization to use a factory pattern for better testability
- Evaluate performance of batch operations for large employee datasets
- Implement comprehensive error boundary pattern for UI components
- Enhance test coverage for LLM service and agent implementations
