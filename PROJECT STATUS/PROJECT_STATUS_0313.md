- Drizzle ORM and Supabase for database management
- Clean UI with Shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- Robust monitoring with Sentry and PostHog

Areas that need technical attention:
- Some TypeScript type definitions need refinement
- Database migration scripts for consistent deployments
- Test coverage for core functionality
- Performance optimization for data-heavy components

## Recent Fixes (March 13)

1. **HR Dashboard Overview Tab**
   - Fixed issue with dashboard not displaying components
   - Removed artificial database check failures in development mode

2. **Employee Profile Pages**
   - Fixed "Employee ID is required" error by improving URL path parameter extraction
   - Resolved DOM nesting warnings in skeleton loading components

3. **Database Schema Improvements**
   - Added employee_rag_history table for proper RAG status tracking
   - Implemented UUID generation for database records

4. **Error Handling**
   - Improved notification service to handle unauthenticated states gracefully

## Conclusion

Learnfinity Spark v3 has a strong foundation with core HR and learning management features implemented. The current focus should be on:

1. Completing data synchronization between UI and database
2. Enhancing the intervention and analytics systems
3. Refining the user experience with better error handling and loading states
4. Developing the advanced AI-driven recommendation features
